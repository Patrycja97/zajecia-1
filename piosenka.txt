Down, down, down by the river
Down, down, down by the river
Down, down, down by the river (By the river)

Inky embers (Inky embers)
Swirl and dance (Swirl and dance)
Just leave the flames and take a chance
To be with me tonight
Take my hand
And hold it tight
'Causе you and I are everywhеre
The night is young, we're going

Down, down, down by the river (By the river)
Down, down, down by the river
Down, down, down by the river (By the river)

Don't wake me up
Just leave me there dreaming
